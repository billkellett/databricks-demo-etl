# databricks-demo-etl
Demo an ETL use case using disparate data sources... *securely* with Databricks Secrets!

This project contains Notebooks and other resources for a __Databricks Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) demo__.

To install and run this demo in your own Databricks environment:

1. Import the PREP notebook from the following URL: https://github.com/billkellett/databricks-demo-etl/blob/master/notebooks/ETL_PREP.dbc

2. Open the PREP notebook and do a "Run All."  The notebook will format all data needed for the actual demo.

3. Import the DEMO notebook from the following URL: https://github.com/billkellett/databricks-demo-etl/blob/master/notebooks/ETL_PREP.dbc

4. Open the DEMO notebook and follow its step-by-step instructions.

__NOTE:__ To run this demo, you will need access to both SQL Server and MySQL databases.  If you do not have such access, you can still install the notebooks and walk through the steps.  We have left the results in the ETL Notebook (but not in the PREP notebook) so you can simply follow along and look at results from a previous run.
